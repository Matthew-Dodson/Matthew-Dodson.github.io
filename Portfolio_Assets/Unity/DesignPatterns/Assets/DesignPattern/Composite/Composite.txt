What is a Composite Design Pattern?
This particular design pattern envolves setting up objects into a sort of tree structure, where every element is responsible
for preforming a specific task. This also means that each node in the structure is either a branch node 
(has something split off of it) or is a leaf node (has nothing after it).

List when to use this design pattern
The composite design pattern is primarily used to split something big into smaller parts to make it more manageable.

List why we don't want to use this design pattern.
I would image that you wouldn't use this pattern when the code cannot be easily broken down into more specific elements.
