Using Maya 2015, I have created several 3D models and have included several 3D rendered images.

These images represent:

A textured Hand with functional joints for posing.

A textured & upscaled 3D Pencil to be "held" by the Hand.

A whisk.

An untextured spiked mace.

An untextured AT-AT.

A unique Golem-like character that I personally designed for the 3D Modeling class' final project. 
	- Has posable hands and animated "leg" crystals.
