The SpaceRocks program was build from a guided tutorial. 
The Flash Game Development course required us to make several significant modifications.
For this I changed the movement system to follow the mouse instead of keyboard controls,
changed the rocks to bounce off one-another (instead of flying over each other),
and made the game wave based with a score tracker.

To run the game, double click the SpaceRocks.swf file in the SpaceRocks V2 folder.
